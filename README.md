# CrochetCraze
Here is where the main Crochet Project Website will be located (as long as I don't break it).

This website is my Senior Project as a Digital Media, Arts and Technology (DIGIT) major with a minor in Writing and Digital Media. This site's subject revolves around a very familiar hobby of Crocheting while also demonstrating skills I've learned and will continue to learn as a Web Developer. The site will be for beginner crocheters who would like to learn basic stitches, patterns and history.

The site will contain Home, Stitches, Patterns and Calculator page for navigation. The Stitches and Patterns pages will act as landing pages for a selection of individual stitch/pattern pages. I am also thinking about creating a History page and a Yarn page too. History will give a brief history of crocheting, and the Yarn page will give descriptions of different types of yarn and what projects work best for each yarn.

Within each individual Stitch page, there will be the name of a unique stitch, stitch symbol, and stitch SVG animation. There will also be a switch labeled “Lefty” to switch the crochet stitch animation for one that is friendly to left-handed people.

Within an individual Pattern page, there will be the name of a unique pattern, a legend for stitches, and the pattern itself. For each unique pattern, there will be two versions, a visual pattern made in SVG and a written pattern. I haven’t decided on how I would want to display the two, but I am leaning to an in-page tabbing system. The visual pattern’s stitches will be hoverable to display the name of the stitch and a GIF of the animation. On click you will be taken to the unique stitch page. The same hover and click features will apply to the text pattern as well.

The Calculator page will display a prompt to fill out all the specifications of a project the user wants to start but doesn’t know how much yarn is required i.e. a 6 x 5 throw blanket using 5.5mm yarn and hook and mostly double stitches. Based on what the user inputs, the calculator will spit out an answer of the amount of yarn necessary.

Some languages I will be enhancing through this project are:
-	JavaScript
-	Eleventy (11ty)
-	SVG and SVG animation

     Using a combination of all languages, I am planning on using this site to build multiple pages with many forms of content types. Such as:

-	Text
-	Images
-	Animations
-	GIFs
-	Hoverable Text paths that will show content
-	Hoverable SVG paths that will show content
-	Togglable Switch Buttons
-	Calculator
- 
This is my plan for my Senior Project as of now, but I may scrap, add or revise some of these features as the semester progresses, but hopefully I can get to all of it, if not I’ll finish it later on my own time!
