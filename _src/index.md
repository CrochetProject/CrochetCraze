## Welcome

This website is my Senior Project as a Digital Media, Arts and Technology (DIGIT) major with a minor in Writing and Digital Media. This site's subject revolves around a very familiar hobby of Crocheting while also demonstrating skills I've learned and will continue to learn as a Web Developer. The site will be for beginner crocheters who would like to learn basic stitches and patterns.

The site currently contains a Home, Stitches, Patterns and a Behind the Scenes page. As of 12/20/2025, this accredited senior project is complete, but I still plan on developing it further in my own time. 

I aim to add more Pattern and Stitch pages and eventually create a Calculator page. The Calculator page will feature a calculator that asks for certain parameters about yarn size, hook size and project size to calculate an approximate amount of yarn needed to complete a crochet project. 

The languages and applicable skills enhanced through this project are:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Eleventy (11ty)
- SVG
- Adobe After Effects
- Nunjucks

Using a combination of all these technologies, this site contains many forms of content, such as:

- Text
- Images
- Animations
- Hoverable Text paths that will show content
- Hoverable SVG paths that will show content

This project was a huge roller coaster full of trial and error. In the Behind the Scenes, I have a step-by-step of using 11ty to build a site just like this one. I also have an in-depth article on my thought process with SVGs and why they were a struggle here.
