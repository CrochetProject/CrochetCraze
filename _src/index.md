## Welcome



This website is my Senior Project as a Digital Media, Arts and Technology (DIGIT) major with a minor in Writing and Digital Media. This site's subject revolves around a very familiar hobby of Crocheting while also demonstrating skills I've learned and will continue to learn as a Web Developer. The site will be for beginner crocheters who would like to learn basic stitches, patterns and history.

The site will contain Home, Stitches, Patterns and Calculator page for navigation. The Stitches and Patterns pages will act as landing pages for a selection of individual stitch/pattern pages. I am also thinking about creating a History page and a Yarn page too. History will give a brief history of crocheting, and the Yarn page will give descriptions of different types of yarn and what projects work best for each yarn.

Some languages I will be enhancing through this project are:
- JavaScript
- Eleventy (11ty)
- SVG and SVG animation

Using a combination of all languages, I am planning on using this site to build multiple pages with many forms of content types. Such as:
- Text
- Images
- Animations
- GIFs
- Hoverable Text paths that will show content
- Hoverable SVG paths that will show content
- Togglable Switch Buttons
- Calculator

This is my plan for my Senior Project as of now, but I may scrap, add or revise some of these features as the semester progresses, but hopefully I can get to all of it, if not Iâ€™ll finish it later on my own time! For a more fleshed out plan for this page visit this sites GitHub repo!
