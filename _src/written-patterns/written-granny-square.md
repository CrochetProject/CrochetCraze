Starting the Granny Square:
- Chain 4 and join to form a loop. 

Row 1:
- Chain 3 (counts as your first double crochet), then work 2 more double crochets into the ring. This forms your first 3 dc cluster.
- Chain 2 (this is your first corner), then make another cluster of 3 double crochets into the same ring. Repeat this three more times to complete the first round.
- Join with a slip stitch to the top of the initial chain-3.

Row 2:
- Turn your work.
- Chain 3 (counts as your first double crochet), then work 2 more double crochets into the same corner space.
- Chain 2 (corner), then make another cluster of 3 double crochets into the same corner.
- Chain 1, skip the next shell, and make a cluster of 3 double crochets into the next corner space.
- Repeat the corner pattern (cluster, chain 2, cluster) around the square.
- Join with a slip stitch to the top of the initial chain-3.

Row 3 - ... :
- Turn work.
- Chain 3, 2 dc, chain 1, 3 dc in next space
- Continue chain 1 and 3 dc until you reach a corner space and 3 dc, 2 chain, 3 dc
- Repeat the last two steps until the row is complete and slip stitch to the top of the initial chain-3.
- Repeat this entire step until the granny square is large enough, then fasten off.
