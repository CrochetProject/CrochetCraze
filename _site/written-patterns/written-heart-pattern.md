Starting the Granny Square:
- Chain 4 and join to form a loop.

Row 1:
- Chain 3 (counts as your first double crochet), then work 2 more double crochets into the ring. This forms your first 3 dc cluster.
- Chain 2 (this is your first corner), then make another cluster of 3 double crochets into the same ring. Repeat this three more times to complete the first round.
- Join with a slip stitch to the top of the initial chain-3.

Row 2:
- Chain 3 (counts as your first double crochet), then work 2 more double crochets into the same corner space.
- Chain 2 (corner), then make another cluster of 3 double crochets into the same corner.
- Chain 1, skip the next shell, and make a cluster of 3 double crochets into the next corner space.
- Repeat the corner pattern (cluster, chain 2, cluster) around the square.
- Join with a slip stitch to the top of the initial chain-3.

Two Half Circle:
- Slip stitch in next chain to move up to the tip of the corner.
- Dc into the chain-1 space between the two dc clusters.
- Dc in that same space 10 more times.
- Slip stitch into tip of corner.
- Dc into the chain-1 space between the two dc clusters.
- Dc in that same space 10 more times.
- Slip stitch into tip of corner.
- Fasten off.
