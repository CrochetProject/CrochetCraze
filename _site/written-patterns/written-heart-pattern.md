Starting the Granny Square:
- <span class="chain">Chain</span> 4 and join to form a loop.

Row 1:
- <span class="chain">Chain</span> 3 (counts as your first <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span>), then work 2 more <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span>s into the ring. This forms your first 3 <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span> cluster.
- <span class="chain">Chain</span> 2 (this is your first corner), then make another cluster of 3 <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span>s into the same ring. Repeat this three more times to complete the first round.
- Join with a <span class="slipSt">Slip stitch</span> to the top of the initial <span class="chain">Chain</span>-3.

Row 2:
- <span class="chain">Chain</span> 3 (counts as your first <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span>), then work 2 more <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span>s into the same corner space.
- <span class="chain">Chain</span> 2 (corner), then make another cluster of 3 <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span>s into the same corner.
- <span class="chain">Chain</span> 1, skip the next shell, and make a cluster of 3 <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span>s into the next corner space.
- Repeat the corner pattern (cluster, <span class="chain">Chain</span> 2, cluster) around the square.
- Join with a <span class="slipSt">Slip stitch</span> to the top of the initial <span class="chain">Chain</span>-3.

Two Half Circle:
- <span class="slipSt">Slip stitch</span> in next <span class="chain">Chain</span> to move up to the tip of the corner.
- <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span> into the <span class="chain">Chain</span>-1 space between the two <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span> clusters.
- <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span> in that same space 10 more times.
- <span class="slipSt">Slip stitch</span> into tip of corner.
- <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span> into the <span class="chain">Chain</span>-1 space between the two <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span> clusters.
- <span class="textDBCrochet">Double crochet</span> in that same space 10 more times.
- <span class="slipSt">Slip stitch</span> into tip of corner.
- Fasten off.
